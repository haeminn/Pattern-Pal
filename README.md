# PatternPal

**PatternPal is an iOS application built to help children with autism**


Children with autism spectrum disorder experience trouble with a wide range of tasks and with varying degrees of difficulty. Among these issues, some often have difficulty shifting their attention to perform daily activities. 

Our app aims to help kids with autism gain more independence. We believe that switching tasks is one of the main issues and so we decided to address this issue in our app, PatternPal.
